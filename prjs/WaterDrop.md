## Data Mining Guided Molecular Investigations on the Coalescence of Water Droplets

**Project description:** In this work, the mutual effects of water and asphaltene (a substance found in oil) on each other were discussed. The trajectories of water molecules in various systems were processed to extract nearly 5000 snapshots consisting of 300 to 900 water molecules. The position of these molecules in each snapshot were then mapped to the nodes of a graph <strong>G</strong>. An edge would be added between two nodes in a time step if and only if the distance between the corresponding molecules is smaller than a certain value. Now, the connected components of <strong>G</strong> would represent the clusters of water molecules in each time step. Studying the changes in the number of clusters and their composition provides some knowledge on molecular origins of water coalescence in oil.
