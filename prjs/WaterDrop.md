## Data Mining Guided Molecular Investigations on the Coalescence of Water Droplets

**Project description:** In this work, the mutual effects of water and asphaltene on each other were discussed. The trajectories of water molecules in various systems were processed to extract nearly 5000 snapshots consisting of 300 to 900 water molecules. The position of these molecules in each snapshot were then mapped to the nodes of a graph \(G\) analysis was performed
