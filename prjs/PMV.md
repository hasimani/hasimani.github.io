## Using multivariate linear regression to obtain partial molar volumes

**Project description:** 
Several control volumes are inserted into the simulation domain of various multi component mixtures. The number of each component inside each of the control volumes is counted. These numbers are used to calculate partial molar volumes of components using multivariate linear regression.
